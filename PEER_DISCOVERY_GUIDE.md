# Peer Discovery Implementation Guide

## Overview

Successfully implemented local peer-to-peer discovery using Multipeer Connectivity for the Proxima app. This allows users to discover and connect with nearby professionals on the same local network.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Package Installation

- Installed `react-native-multipeer-connectivity` (v0.1.0)
- Integrated with iOS CocoaPods

### 2. iOS Permissions (Info.plist)

Added required permissions for local network discovery:

- **NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription**: Explains why the app needs local network access
- **NSBonjourServices**: Defines the Bonjour service types for discovery
  - `_proxima-networking._tcp`
  - `_proxima-networking._udp`

### 3. New Screen: NearbyPeersScreen

Location: `/src/screens/NearbyPeersScreen.tsx`

Features:

- **Real-time peer discovery**: Automatically discovers nearby users running the app
- **User information exchange**: Shares and receives JSON payloads with userId and name
- **Live peer list**: Updates in real-time as peers join/leave
- **Data transmission**: Send your info to all discovered peers
- **Refresh capability**: Reset and restart discovery
- **Platform check**: iOS-only feature with proper error handling

### 4. Navigation Updates

- Updated `AppNavigator.tsx` to include the new peers screen
- Added navigation route: 'peers'
- Integrated with existing navigation flow

### 5. HomeScreen Updates

- Added "🔍 Discover Nearby Professionals" button
- Positioned below the main CTA for easy access

## How It Works

### Service Name

```typescript
const SERVICE_NAME = 'proxima-networking';
```

### Data Exchange Format

```json
{
  "userId": "user_abc123",
  "name": "Anonymous User",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-25T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Key Features

1. **Automatic Discovery**: The screen automatically initializes multipeer connectivity on mount
2. **Advertise & Browse**: Simultaneously advertises your presence and browses for others
3. **Peer Lifecycle**: Handles peer found/lost events to maintain an accurate peer list
4. **Data Reception**: Listens for incoming data and updates peer info dynamically

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **iOS devices only** (Multipeer Connectivity is iOS-specific)
- Both devices must be on the same local network
- Both devices must have the app installed and running

### Steps to Test

1. **Build and install on iOS**:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/banhdit/Documents/meeting/proxima
   npm run ios
   # or
   npx react-native run-ios
   ```

2. **On Device 1**:

   - Open the app
   - Tap "🔍 Discover Nearby Professionals"
   - You'll see your user info and a "Searching for nearby peers..." message

3. **On Device 2**:

   - Open the app
   - Tap "🔍 Discover Nearby Professionals"
   - Both devices should now see each other in the peer list

4. **Test data exchange**:
   - Tap "Send My Info to All" on either device
   - The other device should receive the data (check console logs)

### Expected Behavior

- Peers appear within 1-2 seconds of opening the screen
- Peer count updates in the header
- Green status indicator shows active peers
- Peers disappear when the other device closes the screen or app

## Troubleshooting

### No Peers Found

1. **Check permissions**: Ensure local network permission is granted
2. **Same network**: Both devices must be on the same WiFi network
3. **Firewall**: Check if firewall is blocking local network discovery
4. **Restart**: Try refreshing discovery or restarting the app

### Permission Denied

- Go to Settings > Privacy > Local Network > Proxima
- Enable local network access

### Build Issues

```bash
# Clean and rebuild iOS
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
npm run ios
```

## Technical Details

### Platform Support

- **iOS**: ✅ Full support via Multipeer Connectivity
- **Android**: ❌ Not supported (Multipeer Connectivity is iOS-only)

For Android support, you would need to implement an alternative solution using:

- WiFi Direct
- Nearby API
- Custom peer discovery

### Security Considerations

- **Local network only**: Peers are only discoverable on the same local network
- **No authentication**: Current implementation has no authentication
- **Plain text data**: Data is sent as plain JSON (consider encryption for production)

### Production Recommendations

1. **Add user authentication**: Verify peer identity before accepting connections
2. **Implement encryption**: Encrypt data payloads
3. **Add rate limiting**: Prevent spam/DoS attacks
4. **User profile integration**: Replace anonymous users with actual user profiles
5. **Connection state management**: Handle app backgrounding/foregrounding
6. **Error recovery**: Implement retry logic for failed transmissions

## Code Structure

```
src/
├── screens/
│   ├── NearbyPeersScreen.tsx    # Main peer discovery screen
│   └── HomeScreen.tsx            # Updated with navigation button
├── navigation/

```

## API Reference

### Multipeer Methods Used

```typescript
// Initialize with service name
Multipeer.initialize(serviceName: string)

// Start advertising with user data
Multipeer.advertise(data: object)

// Listen for peer discovery
Multipeer.onPeerFound(callback: (peer) => void)

// Listen for peer loss
Multipeer.onPeerLost(callback: (peer) => void)

// Listen for data reception
Multipeer.onReceive(callback: (data, peer) => void)

// Send data to all peers
Multipeer.sendToAll(data: string)

// Stop advertising and browsing
Multipeer.stop()
```

## Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Chat functionality**: Add peer-to-peer messaging
2. **File sharing**: Exchange business cards or documents
3. **Profile viewing**: Show detailed peer profiles
4. **Connection requests**: Add accept/reject flow
5. **History**: Keep track of previously connected peers
6. **Bluetooth fallback**: Use Bluetooth when WiFi is unavailable
7. **Android support**: Implement alternative for Android devices
